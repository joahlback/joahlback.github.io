I'm a post-doctoral fellow in the [Methodology department](https://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology) at the London School of Economics and Political Science. 
My research interests focus on political and electoral behaviour, electoral integrity, and development aid in low-income democracies. 
My regional specialisation is Sub-Saharan Africa. My work has been published in Journal of Development Economics. 
Previously, I worked in the Department for Politics and International Relations in Royal Holloway, University of London. 
I received my PhD in political science from the Government Department at the LSE.
