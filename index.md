I'm a post-doctoral fellow in the [Methodology department](https://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology) at the London School of Economics and Political Science. I study political and electoral behaviour, electoral integrity, and development aid in low-income democracies, using experimental and survey methods, and quasi-experimental approaches. My regional specialisation is Sub-Saharan Africa. My work has been published in the Journal of Development Economics. Previously, I worked in the Department for Politics and International Relations in Royal Holloway, University of London. I received my PhD in political science from the Government Department at the LSE.
