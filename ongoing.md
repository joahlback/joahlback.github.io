## Building voter confidence in election results: a conjoint experiment in Malawi

- with Alex Yeandle

Amidst growing concern about disinformation in elections, public faith in official election results have never felt more important. From the US to Brazil to the DRC, results are regularly challenged in court and their legitimacy called into question, placing increasing importance on how elections are administered and how voters’ confidence in them can be ensured. Such interventions – like polling staff training, the presence of monitors, and transparency of election results – have been found to reduce “objective” electoral irregularities in many countries. Yet, we know little about how these shape “subjective” judgements by voters themselves, and if they enhance trust in the legitimacy of elections. Our principal research questions regard how different polling station interventions impact on voter confidence: Is voter confidence affected by the level of education and training of election staff? Is confidence instead enhanced by the presence of different election monitors at the polling station? Or is it primarily driven by voters’ own possibility to verify results? And how does partisanship affect this? Do voters value non-partisan measures that may strengthen the legitimacy of the entire election? Or do they principally only value arrangements that would benefit their own side? We will answer these questions through a conjoint choice experiment in Malawi. Respondents are presented with pairs of polling station profiles, containing randomised information about the level of education of polling station staff, the presence and type of different election monitors and party representatives, and transparency measures in place. Respondents are then asked to select the polling stations they think will deliver more accurate results, ‘reflecting the will of the people’.

## Foreign aid is neither a curse nor a blessing: Explaining the effects of foreign aid on voting behaviour and accountability

- with Ryan Jablonski and Brigitte Seim

How does foreign aid change electoral behavior? We provide a theory to reconcile mixed evidence. We argue that when foreign aid is seen by voters as highly politicized, aid can be a double-edged sword for politicians. The net effects of aid on elections will depend on the dispersion of aid and citizen beliefs about how aid \textit{should} have been distributed. To test our argument, we conducted a survey among 2,331 citizens around a sample of 180 schools in Malawi before and after the delivery of a highly targeted foreign aid project in the education sector. Additionally, we conducted a SMS-based information experiment which varied voter knowledge about the aid allocation process. In line with expectations, we confirm that voters who live in an area that receives foreign aid were more likely to anticipate voting for incumbent councillors and rate incumbent performance as high. Further, we show that aid increased the number of visits by incumbents and we provide anecdotal evidence of more credit claiming activity by politicians. The results of the SMS experiment, however, demonstrate that aid can also be a double-edged sword: when citizens learn about aid, but fail to benefit, we document a sizable backlash against incumbents. Citizens were less likely to be satisfied with or vote for incumbents in this condition. Collectively, these finding imply highly variable net effects of foreign aid on electoral outcomes. The study also implies ways in which donors might minimize adverse political consequences from aid delivery.
