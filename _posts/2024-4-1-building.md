title: "Building voter confidence in election results: a conjoint experiment in Malawi"
---

- with Alex Yeandle (funded project)



Amidst growing concern about disinformation in elections, public faith in official election results have never felt more important. From the US to Brazil to the DRC, results are regularly challenged in court and their legitimacy called into question, placing increasing importance on how elections are administered and how voters’ confidence in them can be ensured. Such interventions – like polling staff training, the presence of monitors, and transparency of election results – have been found to reduce “objective” electoral irregularities in many countries. Yet, we know little about how these shape “subjective” judgements by voters themselves, and if they enhance trust in the legitimacy of elections. Our principal research questions regard how different polling station interventions impact on voter confidence: Is voter confidence affected by the level of education and training of election staff? Is confidence instead enhanced by the presence of different election monitors at the polling station? Or is it primarily driven by voters’ own possibility to verify results? And how does partisanship affect this? Do voters value non-partisan measures that may strengthen the legitimacy of the entire election? Or do they principally only value arrangements that would benefit their own side? We will answer these questions through a conjoint choice experiment in Malawi. Respondents are presented with pairs of polling station profiles, containing randomised information about the level of education of polling station staff, the presence and type of different election monitors and party representatives, and transparency measures in place. Respondents are then asked to select the polling stations they think will deliver more accurate results, ‘reflecting the will of the people’.
